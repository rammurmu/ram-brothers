**The Business Journey**

>

_My business journey starts from 2008 when I was in 7th standard of school.The name of my school was `SS Institute of Human Development`.The name of my principal madam is `Usha Rai` who gave me the title of `Best Student of the Year in 2009`. And also inspired me to be the best leader. It is with his inspiration that today I have reached the journey from a small village in India to  startup school community member, `Silicon Valley Y Combinator Startup School`.I have always used the guidance and discipline shown by him in my studies and works. And by `continuously studying deeply`, I learned something new and acquired new skills.This is the 9-years dream project of my life to learn, research, create and innovate through discipline, hard work, and persevering in-depth study to get from the classroom to the boardroom._
