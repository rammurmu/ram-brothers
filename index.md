# The Ram Murmu Story🎤 # 
  
 Last update Nov 9,2021
  
**The Start february 2011🎉🎉**
 > 
 _We Started Working together on a Startup Idea in 2011.The first time I read and hear about the eCommerce business technology Society.By Kenneth C. Laudon and Carol Guercio Traver ,Written Book📖 "E-COMMERCE" FIRST IMPRESSION,2006 (New York University).and Real-World Real-Business Startup Ventures Case Study._

_My name is Ram Murmu I am 27 years old.I was born on November 11, 1994.My late grandfather's name is `Rameshwar Murmu`,and father's name is `Sanu Murmu` and brother's name is `Vaibhav Murmu` and younger sister's name is `Vitteey Nirali Murmu`._
My grandfather was a farmer and when our land was taken by Bokaro Steel Plant (SAIL) then my grandfather got a job in the operation department in the plant._ 
My business journey starts from 2008 when I was in 7th standard of school.The name of my school was `SS Institute of Human Development`.The name of my principal madam is `Usha Rai` who gave me the title of `🥇Best Student of the Year in 2009`. And also inspired me to be the best leader. It is with his inspiration that today I have reached the journey from a small village in India to `Silicon Valley Y Combinator Startup School`.I have always used the guidance and discipline shown by him in my studies and works. And by `continuously studying deeply`, I learned something new and acquired new skills._

_Our family business started from 2008. We started business with an offline retail store _Shri Ram General Store_
  
I Started Working, Studies, and research together the Innovative Idea in 2011.My grandfather and my principal madam inspired me to be the best leader. It is with his inspiration that today I have reached the Silicon Valley Y Combinator Startup School.I have always used the guidance and discipline shown by him in my studies and works. And by continuously studying deeply and Learn from the world's best, I learned something new and acquired new skills.This is the 9-years dream project of my life to learn, research, create and innovate through discipline, hard work, and persevering in-depth study to get from the School classroom to the boardroom.When I started walking, there was no road in front of me, no support system to move forward, there was only one MSME scheme in India from where I could get help.But that too I did not get help to start my business, I was told that we do not provide help for cyber business.then I was realized that there is no way to start a small business in India, the only way was education which will teach me and tell me how a big business can be made and solved.then I challenged myself to build a better solution to this problem. I have faced personally this burning problem when I started my first unorganized offline retail business in 2008. I need lack adequate capital and resources and too much time required hard work and struggle but does not reach my needs and goals, I have seen that many more unorganized retail businesses face this problem daily basis, and yers later turn into successful businesses there was no solution locally.so I decided to solve this problem. and I will make a sustainable, affordable, efficient business model and do something different from the retail industry.So I Studies and research deeply for 9 years.and today building the first live retail streaming platform.
