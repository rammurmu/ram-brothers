_My name is Ram Murmu I am 27 years old.My late grandfather's name is `Rameshwar Murmu`, and my late grandmother's name is `Hira Muni Devi Murmu`.My father's name is `Sanu Murmu` and my mother's name is `Birji Devi Murmu`.My brother's name is `Vaibhav Murmu` and my elder sister's name is `Pooja Kumari Murmu` and younger sister's name is `Vitteey Nirali Murmu`.
My grandfather always used to tell me that everything is possible with hard work. and everything can be found.  
I was born on November 11, 1994.My grandfather was a farmer and when our land was taken by Bokaro Steel Plant (SAIL) then my grandfather got a job in the operation department in the plant._ 
_My business journey starts from 2007 when I was in 7th standard of school.The name of my school was `SS Institute of Human Development`.The name of my principal madam is `Usha Rai` who gave me the title of `Best Student of the Year in 2009`. And also inspired me to be the best leader. It is with his inspiration that today I have reached the journey from a small village in India to `Silicon Valley Y Combinator Startup School`.I have always used the guidance and discipline shown by him in my studies and works. And by `continuously studying deeply`, I learned something new and acquired new skills._
