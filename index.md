🙏Johar  👏Namast  🤝Hello  👋Hi  ☝Howdy !

# Introduction #



Higher-thinking than Dream!(Dream se bhee uchi soch)
<br>The biggest thing of our startup's journey has to learn from open source. and Learning from the world's best.The most important thing for our startup with new principles is learning. If our startup is a great idea. we don't have to get excited, we have to walk with a clean mind.My grandfather always used to tell me that everything is possible with hard work. and everything can be found.

The Ram Murmu [Story🎤 ](https://medium.com/runash)
  
 
  
**The Start february 2011🎉🎉**
 
 We Started Working together on a Startup Idea in **2011**.The first time I read and hear about the eCommerce business technology Society.By Kenneth C. Laudon and Carol Guercio Traver ,Written Book📖 "E-COMMERCE" FIRST IMPRESSION,**2006** (New York University).and Real-World Real-Business Startup Ventures Case Study.

My name is Ram Murmu I am 27 years old.I was born on November **11, 1994**.My late grandfather's name is Rameshwar Murmu,and father's name is Sanu Murmu and brother's name is Vaibhav Murmu and younger sister's name is Vitteey Nirali Murmu.
My grandfather was a farmer and when our land was taken by Bokaro Steel Plant (SAIL) then my grandfather got a job in the operation department in the plant._ 
My business journey starts from **2008** when I was in 7th standard of school.The name of my school was SS Institute of Human Development.The name of my principal madam is Usha Rai who gave me the title of 🥇Best Student of the Year in **2009**. And also inspired me to be the best leader. It is with his inspiration that today I have reached the journey from a small village in India to Silicon Valley Y Combinator Startup School.I have always used the guidance and discipline shown by him in my studies and works. And by continuously studying deeply, I learned something new and acquired new skills._


**The Business Journy** ✨ 

Our family business started from **2008**. We started business with an offline retail store **Shri Ram General Store**
  
I Started Working, Studies, and research together the Innovative Idea in **2011**.My grandfather and my principal madam inspired me to be the best leader. It is with his inspiration that today I have reached the Silicon Valley Y Combinator Startup School.I have always used the guidance and discipline shown by him in my studies and works. And by continuously studying deeply and Learn from the world's best, I learned something new and acquired new skills.This is the 9-years dream project of my life to learn, research, create and innovate through discipline, hard work, and persevering in-depth study to get from the School classroom to the boardroom.When I started walking, there was no road in front of me, no support system to move forward, there was only one **MSME** scheme in India from where I could get help.But that too I did not get help to start my business, I was told that we do not provide help for cyber business.then I was realized that there is no way to start a small business in India, the only way was education which will teach me and tell me how a big business can be made and solved.then I challenged myself to build a better solution to this problem. I have faced personally this burning problem when I started my first unorganized offline retail business in **2008***. I need lack adequate capital and resources and too much time required hard work and struggle but does not reach my needs and goals, I have seen that many more unorganized retail businesses face this problem daily basis, and yers later turn into successful businesses there was no solution locally.so I decided to solve this problem. and I will make a sustainable, affordable, efficient business model and do something different from the retail industry.So I Studies and research deeply for **9** years.and today building the first live retail streaming platform.
